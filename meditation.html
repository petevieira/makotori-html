<h3 id="absence_of_self">Absence of Self</h3>
<ul>
<li>One goal is really the remove the self, the ego, the entity in the mind that identifies with things and judges things.</li>
<li>The result would be just the energy that is in the body, that is ever-connected with all things.</li>
<li>So how does one reach this state while trying to reach this state, which is the self that's trying to reach the state?
<ul>
<li>Do you force a habit of non-judgment via continual meditation practice?</li>

<h3 id="insight_vipassana_meditation">Insight (Vipassana) Meditation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unlike concentration practices in which attention is fixed on a single object, vipassana (insight) meditation focuses on the constantly changing nature of experience. “Insight” refers to clearly seeing into the three characteristics of experience: its impermanence, its unsatisfactoriness, and the absence of an inherent self.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how_do_i_practice_vipassana_insight_meditation">How do I practice vipassana [insight] meditation?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sit [with your back straight]. Close your eyes and follow the rising and falling, the rising and falling of the abdomen as you breathe. Feel the breath. When watching the breathing in and out, ask yourself, “Where is the touch of the breath?” Keep your mind on the touch only. You are to do nothing with the breathing, only feel the touch. If it is heavy, let it be heavy. It if is short, let it be short. If it is fine, let it be fine. Just feel it. When your mind wanders away, notice this and say to yourself, “Thinking,” and then come back again to the rising and falling of the breath. If you feel a sensation somewhere else, like pain in the leg, then take your mind to the pain and note, “Pain.” And when it goes away or fades, then again come to watching the touch of the breath. If restlessness comes, note “restlessness.” If you hear a noise, say to yourself, “Hearing, hearing,” then again come back to the feeling of the breath. If memories come, know them as “memories.” Anything you see, anything that comes to mind, just be aware of it. If you see visions or lights, just note “seeing” or “lights.” There is no need to keep any of it, to make it stay. Simply observe. In insight meditation, you are observing the rising and falling of the breath and the phenomena that arise in the mind and body. So there is a shifting of the mind from sensations felt, both painful and pleasurable, to thoughts as well. Whatever is happening is to be noticed, then that will go away, and another thing will come. In this way, insight practice is a method of observation. All six senses [the mind being the sixth] will arise. Just watch them arise and pass away and come back to the feeling of the breath. Anything you see, anything that comes to mind, just be aware of it.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what_is_the_purpose_of_insight_meditation">What is the purpose of insight meditation?</h4>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of insight meditation is to eliminate the Ten Fetters, which are the knots or obstructions in your mind. Very slowly, by observing every moment with awareness, you come to open these knots. The Ten Fetters are self-illusion [that is, the illusion of a separate self], doubt, attachment to rites and rituals, lust, ill-will, craving, craving for fine material existence, conceit, restlessness, ignorance. At each stage of enlightenment, slowly, one by one, some of the fetters are extinguished, until the fourth stage, or arahantship, when all the fetters are gone. The fetters are related to birth in the same way that oil feeds the light of a lamp. The fetters are like oil in your mind. As the oil becomes less and less, the light from the wick becomes less and less. Finally, when the oil is gone, the light is gone. Once they are extinguished, the cycle of rebirth ends. From this, you can understand that birth and rebirth are in your hands.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>

<h2 id="lessons_from_dipa_ma">Lessons from Dipa Ma<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></h2>
<ol>
<li><em>Choose one meditation practice and stick with it “If you want to progress in meditation, stay with one technique.”</em>
<ul>
<li>For those beginning the spiritual journey, Dipa Ma was adamant about commitment to one style of meditation. Don’t give up, and don’t jump around from practice to practice. Find a technique that suits you, and keep going until you find your “edge,” the point where difficulties start to arise.</li>
<li>A common mistake many Western spiritual seekers make is to interpret difficulties as a problem with a particular practice. Then, when the going gets tough, the tough go “spiritual shopping.” From the vantage point of that uncomfortable edge, some other practice always looks better. “Maybe I should do Tibetan chanting . . . or Sufi dancing.” In fact, difficulties usually are a reliable sign that the practice is working.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Meditate every day “Practice now. Don’t think you will do more later.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Dipa Ma stated firmly that if you want peace, you must practice regularly. She insisted that students find time for formal meditation practice every day, even if only for five minutes. If that proved impossible, she advised, “At least when you are in bed at night, notice just one in-breath and one out-breath before you fall asleep.” Besides formal sitting on the cushion, Dipa Ma urged students to make every moment of their lives a meditation. Dipa Ma wouldn’t hear of this; she insisted that meditation is always possible, that it is not separate from life. “If you are busy, then busyness is the meditation,” she told him. “When you do calculations, know that you are doing calculations. Meditation is to know what you are doing. If you are rushing to the office, then you should be mindful of ‘rushing.’ When you are eating, putting on your shoes, your socks, your clothes, you must be mindful. It is all meditation! Even when you are cutting your nails, put your mind there. Know that you are cutting your nails.” For Dipa Ma, mindfulness wasn’t something she did, it was who she was—all the time. The best attitude with which to approach this practice, she said, is with trust and willingness. When your mind wanders, simply begin again. Dipa Ma made it clear that there is nothing wrong with lapses of mindfulness. “It happens to everyone. It is not a permanent problem. Don’t worry, just start again. Always maintain your effort, patience, and faith.” Even when you lose energy and motivation, she advised, just notice that, then shift to another mindfulness practice—walking, awareness in ordinary activity, or sitting—in which more motivation is present.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Any situation is workable “Each of us has enormous power. It can be used to help ourselves and help others.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Dipa Ma came to understand that she could make her family part of the journey. Dipa Ma’s approach was a radical inclusiveness—everything and the kitchen sink. “There is nothing ultimately to cling to in this world,” Dipa Ma taught, “but we can make good use of everything everything in it. Life is not to be rejected. It is here. And as long as it is here and we are here, we can make the best use of it.” To be a true mother is to feel life intensely. To be a true mother is to embrace whatever comes along, with awareness, and to make all circumstances my teachers.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Practice patience “Patience is one of the most important virtues for developing mindfulness and concentration.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Patience is forged by constantly meeting the edge. If you stay with your meditation practice, it is inevitable that difficulties will arise. In the most challenging situations, merely showing up, being present, may be all that is possible—and it may be enough.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Free your mind “Your mind is all stories.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Dipa Ma did not say that the mind is mostly stories; she said that there is nothing in the mind but stories. These are the personal dramas that create and maintain the sense of individual identity: who we are, what we do, what we are and are not capable of. Without our being aware of it, the endless series of such thoughts drives and limits our lives. And yet those stories are without substance. Dipa Ma challenged students’ beliefs in their stories, their attachment to the stories. When someone said, “I can’t do that,” she would ask, “Are you sure?” or “Who says?” or “Why not?” She encouraged students to observe the stories, to see their emptiness, and to go beyond the limitations they impose. “Let go of thinking,” she urged. “Meditation is not about thinking.” At the same time, Dipa Ma taught that the mind is not an enemy to be gotten rid of. Rather, in the process of befriending the mind, in getting to know and accept it, it ceases to be a problem. Dipa Ma knew the freedom that follows that process: she lived in a state of thought-free awareness. In a group interview, Jack Kornfield innocently asked, “What is it like in your mind?” Dipa Ma smiled, closed her eyes, and quietly answered, “In my mind there are three things: concentration, lovingkindness, and peace.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Cool the fire of emotions “Anger is a fire.”</em>
<ul>
<li>When someone came to visit Dipa Ma, it didn’t matter who it was, or what emotional state they were embroiled in, or what the circumstances were, Dipa Ma treated each person with complete, compassionate acceptance. Can we offer the same acceptance to the emotions that arise in us? Can we see our emotional states as visitors to be treated with kindness? Can we simply allow anger and other emotions to arise and pass away, without reacting in ways that might be harmful? “A lot of incidents happen in daily life which are undesirable,” Dipa Ma said. “Sometimes I experience some irritation, but my mind remains cool. Irritation comes and passes. My mind isn’t disturbed by this. Anger is a fire. But I don’t feel any heat. It comes and it dies right out.” Dipa Ma’s example is inspiring, but aren’t there certain occasions when anger might be appropriate? Aren’t there at least some situations when it’s justified? For Dipa Ma the answer was simple: no, anger is never justified. And she found ways to navigate through life without it. Sylvia Boorstein, who hosted Dipa Ma in her California home in 1980, said that her husband once challenged Dipa Ma on this point. “Dipa Ma was talking about the importance of maintaining tranquillity and equanimity and non-anger, and my husband asked her, ‘Could you do that? What if someone were in some way to jeopardize your grandson Rishi, to threaten him?’” “I would stop him, of course,” Dipa Ma replied, “but without anger.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Have fun along the way “I am quite happy. If you come to meditate, you will also be happy.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Jack Engler asked Dipa Ma about the place of fun in Buddhist practice. “This all sounds very gray,” he said. “Getting rid of the passion, getting rid of anger, getting rid of desire. It seems like a kind of gray existence. Where’s the juice?” “Oh, you don’t understand!” Dipa Ma burst out laughing. “There is so much sameness in ordinary life. We are always experiencing everything through the same set of lenses. Once greed, hatred, and delusion are gone, you see everything fresh and new all the time. Every moment is new. Life was dull before. Now, every day, every moment is full of taste and zest.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Simplify. “Live simply. A very simple life is good for everything. Too much luxury is a hindrance to practice.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Even though Dipa Ma and her family lived in two tiny rooms, most visitors perceived those rooms as spacious and filled with light. One student observed that while we in the West think we need a lot of physical space, what Dipa Ma had was a vast psychic space. In every way, Dipa Ma lived in the greatest simplicity. She refrained from socializing. She did not engage in unnecessary talk. She didn’t involve herself in other people’s concerns, especially complaints. Her guideline for herself and her students was to live honestly and never blame others. Often Dipa Ma simply rested in silence. “Whenever I get time alone, I always turn my mind inward,” she said. She did not spend time at any activity that was unnecessary to her life. Just as in meditation we practice giving our full attention to one thing at a time, Dipa Ma did each thing completely without worrying about the next. “Thoughts of the past and future,” she said, “spoil your time.” In whatever she did, she was fully present, with ease, stillness, and simplicity. Dipa Ma encouraged her American students to simplify their material needs. In entering one household she exclaimed, “Why so many things? Why so many pairs of shoes? Why ten boxes of tea? Why? The accumulation of things only increases the want. You will not find any pleasure in plenty.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Cultivate the spirit of blessing “If you bless those around you, this will inspire you to be attentive in every moment.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Dipa Ma made of her life one continuous blessing. She offered blessings to all. She blessed people from head to toe, blowing on them, chanting over them, stroking their hair. Dipa Ma invited a student who was an airline pilot to send lovingkindness and blessings to his passengers and his colleagues while he was flying the plane. She said it would make him more alert and make everyone happy as well. Her blessings were not reserved exclusively for people. Before boarding an airplane she would bestow a blessing upon it. Riding in a car was an opportunity to offer a blessing not only to the vehicle but also to the driver and to the men who pumped the gas. In one of her very first teachings in America, Dipa Ma said, “Meditation is love.” Her spirit of blessing throughout the day was a living example of this teaching. She reminds us that true meditation is about how we care for ourselves and the world; and that ultimately, meditation is the continual movement of love which, similar to one of Dipa Ma’s blessings, encompasses nothing less than everyone and everything.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>It’s a circular journey “Meditation integrates the whole person.”</em>
<ul>
<li>Buddhists speak metaphorically of “leaving the world” and “coming back to the world,” but in truth there is neither leaving the world nor returning to it. We can’t leave or return to our essence, to the rock-bottom truth of our being, because it is and has always been right here, hidden only by a thin film of ignorance. You don’t discover it; rather you allow it to come forth, to emerge from the cloud of unknowing that surrounds you. Seeing into your true nature means realizing that you are inextricably bound to everyone and everything that lives, that you are, indeed, responsible for all that takes place in the world. The beauty of the spiritual journey is that the path invariably takes us back around to our point of departure. When Dipa Ma suffered her childlessness, her husband wisely suggested that she adopt everyone as her own child. But in those difficult days before she encountered the teachings that would transform her life, she was lost in sadness for what she lacked, trying to “fill a hole.” By the end of her life, though, Dipa Ma had indeed become a mother to all. In place of that hole that needed to be filled, there simply was a heart open to all.</li>

<h3 id="worship">Worship</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seems like despite Buddhism not being a religion, in the traditional sense, there is still worship of a deity-like figure, Siddhartha Gautama, or Buddha. Siddhartha never worshiped anyone, he just used trial and error and tried to apply logic and wisdom on the most objective reality he could experience. The idea of worshiping him I assume comes from the idea of enlightenment and his achievement of this, the ending of samsara, or the cycle of birth and death. But this aspect of Buddhism has never seemed to be clarified or explained, which for me makes it interesting, but nothing more. Would Siddhartha have wanted people to worship him. I assume not, since it doesn't really align with any of the noble truths or the eightfold path. Worship seems like a type of envy, which is to be avoided, according to Siddhartha. Does it just provide security? What's the point. If we already have this man, Siddhartha, who apparently reached enlightenment, is it not enough to just treat the man as a man who was wise, which are the facts? This belief in a deity-like figure Buddha seems like a crunch for people's insecurities, as Jiddu Krishnamurti expresses. So for me, what's important is his life and the concepts he learned and his methods of reaching enlightenment. Nothing more. The noble truths and the items in the eightfold path are actually nothing extraordinary. On the contrary, they are rather logical, and I think many come to these conclusions naturally by observing and experiencing the world. It doesn't take a genius to see that positive thoughts, love, honesty, respect, self-awareness, introspection are all important if one wishes to lead a happy life and make others happy and be a source of positive energy in the world.</li>
