  <ul>
    <li>H1: A sentence is a <u>collection of words</u>
      <ul>
        <li>False: There is nothing to distinguish the significance of word order in H1, but we know it's important.</li>

    <li>H2: A sentence is an <u>ordered collection of words</u>
      <ul>
        <li>False: There is nothing to specify what order is good or bad.</li>
        <li>Some substrings consist of words that "belong" more together than others. They are more <strong>cohesive</strong>.</li>

  <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>"Cohesive substrings" = "constituents"</li>
    <li>Note of caution:
      <ul>
        <li>Constituency tests work fine but they are unidirectional</li>
        <li>If they succeed, we know that the relevant substring is a constituent</li>
        <li>If they fail, then either
          <ul>
            <li>the substring is not a constituent</li>
            <li>the substring is a constituent but the test failed for a different reason</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>So, grammar treats some substrings differently from others.</li>
    <li>Some substrings form constituents, others do not.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="organization_of_constituents">Organization of Constituents</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Constituents are always <em>nested</em>. A constituent is <u><em>fully contained</em></u> in another constituent.</li>
    <li>We never find partially overlapping constituents: * <span style="color:red">[</span>word 1 <span style="color:blue">[</span>word 2<span style="color:red">]</span> word 3<span style="color:blue">]</span></li>

        <li>A node α dominates a node β iff there is a descending path from α to β.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mothers</strong>/<strong>Daughters</strong>/<strong>Sisters</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>A node α is the <u>mother</u> of a node β iff α immediately dominates β.</li>
        <li>β is the daughter of α.</li>
        <li>β and ɣ are sisters iff β and ɣ have the same mother α.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>A node α is a terminal node iff α has no daughters.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Exhaustive dominance</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>A node α exhaustively dominates a string S iff
          <ol>
            <li>α dominates every terminal t∈S</li>

  <h3 id="branching">Branching</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We will assume that branching is only binary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="syntactic_tree">Syntactic Tree</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A syntactic tree is a binary branching tree. It is built by iteration of a structure-building operation which has been called "Merge".</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="merge">Merge</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Merge takes two elements α and β, and forms a single, binary branching constituent out of them.
      <ul>
        <li>Merge of two words:<br />

        </li>
        <li>Merge of a word with a constituent formed by a previous iteration of Merge:<br />

  <ul>
    <li>but what is X?
      <ul>
        <li>X will be a "projection" of either 'a' or 'b'. That is, either 'a' or 'b' will pass on some of its properties (or features) to X.<br />
          <img src="img/syntax-tree-merge-projection-a.png" title="fig:Syntax-tree-merge-projection-a.png" width="75" alt="Syntax-tree-merge-projection-a.png" />
        </li>
        <li>Think of the x' notation as indicating that the "xness" of this constituent has been passed up to this node from somewhere else.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="projection">Projection</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Maximal Projection</strong> or <strong>Phrase</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>When the properties of a node stop projecting to the next node up, we call the highest relevant projection "a maximal projection" or a "phrase".</li>
        <li>For example, here when b stops projecting (above d and b') we have "bP" or a "b phrase". Same for "eP".<br />

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What determines which node projects?</li>
    <li>Notion of 'head'
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>head</strong> is a terminal node that determines the properties of a constituent. It cannot be formed by the merge operation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>X<sup>0</sup></strong>: the head</li>
    <li><strong>XP</strong>: the maximal projection</li>

  <ul>
    <li>X<sup>0</sup> is the head of the maximal projection XP.</li>
    <li>What about alpha, beta, and gamma?
      <ul>
        <li>There are maximal projections.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>complement</strong> of X<sup>0</sup> is the sister of X<sup>0</sup>, that is, gamma.</li>
    <li>The <strong>specifier</strong> of the XP is the sister of the highest X', that is, alpha.</li>
    <li>An <strong>adjunct</strong> is a merged constituent that is neither the complement nor the specifier.</li>
    <li>Representations of X':</li>

  <h5 id="which_node_projects">Which node projects</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>What happens when a verb merges with an NP (Noun Phrase)? Which one projects?
      <ul>
        <li>Whichever is the property of the constituent resulting from the merge.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Distributional Tests:
      <ul>
        <li>Given verb "saw" and NP "the fluffy dog" the resulting constituent "saw the fluffy dog" behaves like a verb. Let's test</li>
        <li>It cannot appear as the subject of a sentence, the way an NP can:
          <ol>
            <li>[He] smiled
              <ul>
                <li>*[Saw the fluffy dog] smiled</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It cannot appear as an object, like an NP can:
          <ol>
            <li>I like [him]
              <ul>
                <li>I like *[saw the fluffy dog]</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It CAN appear as a predicate, the way a verb (VP) can:
          <ol>
            <li>He [left]
              <ul>
                <li>He [saw the fluffy dog]</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li>For the tree above, what should the topmost node be, the one marked "?"?</li>
    <li>Another way to ask this is, of which head is this sentence a maximal projection?</li>
    <li>For this class we'll take it as a given that the sentence is a maximal projection of a head that carries the features for tense and subject agreement.</li>
    <li>We'll call this head "<strong>I<sup>0</sup></strong>" for "<strong>Inflection</strong>".</li>
    <li>In this sentence we have
      <ul>
        <li>Past tense</li>
        <li>3<sup>rd</sup> person singular</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><img src="img/syntax-tree-topmost-node.png" title="fig:Syntax-tree-topmost-node.png" width="400" alt="Syntax-tree-topmost-node.png" /></li>
    <li>This assumption that a sentence is the project of an inflection head I<sup>0</sup> consists of two arguments:
      <ol>
        <li>Inflectional material like tense and agreement should be represented as a head separate from the verb. This is most likely because across all languages, inflection is represented differently, and is a change to base morphemes.</li>
        <li>This (inflectional) head is the head of the entire sentence. Axiom that will not be explained in this class.</li>
      </ol>
