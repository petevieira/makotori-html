<h2 id="how_do_we_define_taiji">How do we define Taiji?</h2>
<h3 id="origin_story">Origin Story</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initially the universe was without life. All was foggy and blurry, without differentiation or separation, with no extremities or ends.</li>
<li>This state was called 无极 (wújí, no extremes)</li>
<li>Later the existing energy divided into two extremities, 阴 (yīn) and 阳 (yáng).</li>
<li>This polarity, or tendency to divide is called 太极 (tàijí), the <em>Grand Ultimate</em> or <em>Grand extremity</em>.</li>
<li>This initial separation allows and causes all subsequent divisions and changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general_notions">General Notions</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is generated from 无极 (wújí, no extremes) and is a pivotal function of movement and stillness.</li>
<li>It is the mother of yin and yang.</li>
<li>When it moves it divides. At rest it reunites.</li>
<li>Initially
<ul>
<li>At initial point of practice, the mind, breath and body are still and calm; you are in a state of 无极 (wújí).</li>
<li>气 (qì) is centered, you lack intentions, weight is evenly distributed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then
<ul>
<li>The moment you intend to move and start a movement, you are in a state of 太极 (tàijí).</li>
<li>i.e. 阴 (yīn) and 阳 (yáng) start to be differentiated to perception. Your weight changes from one foot to the other. Various changes occur.</li>
<li>It is the mind that causes the 阴 and 阳 to be discriminated. It is the mind that shapes reality. It is this mind that guides us to a deeper understanding. And this mind learns to achieve and perceive other types of 阴 (yīn) and 阳 (yáng).</li>
<li>So the mind is the 道 (dào, way) in 太极拳 (tàijíquán) practice.</li>
<li>太极拳 (tàijíquán) is primarily an art of the mind.</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="调身_tiáoshēn_regulating_the_body">调身 (tiáoshēn, Regulating the Body)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Along with learning the movements, physical relaxation is a goal.</li>
<li>Relax your mind, feel the balance of your body and maintain your physical and mental centers.</li>
<li>To do this you must practice until you've strengthened and firmed you torso and legs.</li>
<li>Basic condition for your health. With this, 气 (qì) and blood circulation can flow smoothly. Cell replacement will occur without error, a key to health and longevity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="调息_tiáoxī_regulating_the_breath">调息 (tiáoxī, Regulating the Breath)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to breathing and how your body absorbs oxygen and expels carbon dioxide smoothly and profoundly.</li>
<li>Oxygen helps build new cells, while deep exhalation helps eliminate dead cells.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide exists from
<ul>
<li>the biochemical combustion of the food we eat</li>
<li>the body's decay and replenishment. Each cell has a lifetime (skin cells die after 28 days). A trillion cells die each day. We must eliminate these dead cells.</li>
<li>Use as much lung capacity as possible without tensing up</li>
<li>Helps prepare for next stage of regulating the mind.</li>
<li>Breath is the pathway between the external and internal universes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="调心_tiáoxīn_regulating_the_mind">调心 (tiáoxīn, Regulating the Mind)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The mind directs the body against sickness</li>
<li>The mind has 意 (yì, wisdom mind) and 心 (xīn, emotional mind)

<h2 id="personal_questions">Personal Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Why do I want to learn 太极 (tàijí)?
<ol>
<li>Because I'm on a constant quest to better understand life and find deeper, more unifying and universal meaning in it.</li>
<li>I believe hundreds of wise people have shown us that a form of peace and enlightenment exists, and it'd be unwise to not make a full, honest effort to follow in their steps.</li>
<li>I believe and have seen proof in science that 太极 (tàijí) offers many health benefits, so I am intrigued and would like to follow a path that promotes self-healing, self-awareness and longevity.</li>
<li>The idea of being able to control 气 (qì) is amazing and exists in all of us, so we should access it.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What benefits do I hope to gain?
<ol>
<li>Better health and longevity.</li>
<li>Inner and outer peace. A better relationship with the world.</li>
<li>A more unifying perspective of the world and the living things in it.</li>
<li>A better understanding of our place in the world.</li>
<li>A stronger body, mind and spirit.</li>
<li>The ability to really feel, control and use 气 (qì) and 劲 (jìn) for health and to give others evidence of truth in 太极 (tàijí).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Am I likely to continue training for a long time?
<ol>
<li>This is a harder question. I believe the focus on mind and body in the first stage is very important to me, because just working the body lacks motivation and purpose and sense.</li>
<li>How can one master the body without incorporating the mind and breath.</li>
<li>I believe in the ultimate goals of 太极 (tàijí) and the path to these goals always seems to keep the goal in mind and is coherent, which will prevent me from straying off course.</li>
<li>With the idea of detailing out the path of 太极 (tàijí) training, I will never be lost, or wondering what I'm doing or where I am in the process.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="questions_about_the_style_and_master_to_prevent_doubt_or_confusion">Questions about the style and master to prevent doubt or confusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does this 太极拳 (tàijíquán) style offer what I want?</li>
<li>Is the master qualified?</li>
<li>Does this master have a training schedule?</li>
<li>How long and deep can this master teach me?</li>
<li>Will the master teach me everything he knows or will he keep secrets when I approach a certain level?</li>
<li>After I have studied for many years, will I be able to find an advanced master to continue my studies?</li>
<li>To answer these questions, I must survey and investigate. I must know the historical background of the style and the master's experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what_is_the_reverse_order_of_goals">What is the reverse order of goals?</h2>
<h2 id="grounding">Grounding</h2>
<ul>
<li>In battle, a warrior must be able to remain grounded both physically, and psychologically, in order to withstand the onslaught of sensory experience. Without a rational mind directing events from a solid base, techniques and tactics become paper tigers - fierce looking but useless.</li>
<li>In the Chinese martial arts, there is a great emphasis on leg strength, which is developed through grueling drills and the practice of low stances. Why is there such importance placed on leg strength? Research into this question reveals several benefits both physical and psychological.</li>
<li>Low stances exercise the body's largest muscle groups, the femoral biceps, quadriceps, and the gluteus maximus. Improved fuel burning efficiency by these muscles lessens the demand for oxygen on the respiratory system thereby increasing endurance in addition to strength.</li>
<li>Stance training specifically develops the character traits of determination, rationality, and substance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="horse_stance">Horse Stance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directions:
<ul>
<li>Spread your feet about one and a half shoulder widths apart and bend the knees so that the thighs are at about a 60-degree angle.</li>
<li>Press the hands together in front about chest height as if praying. Focus your attention on your center of gravity (Dan Tien) located about two inches below your navel.</li>
<li>Practice standing in a Horse Stance twice a day for about one minute and gradually increasing the duration. Initially you will feel strain, trembling, and burning in the thigh muscles that indicate that those muscles are being worked to exhaustion.</li>
<li>Bend your knees and lower your stance until you can lay a broomstick across your knees without the stick falling off. Just getting into this position is difficult enough and if you can hold the broomstick for three minutes, you will have developed some solid leg muscles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="silk_reeling">Silk Reeling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Silk Reeling (Chan-Su Chin) refers to the method of initiating body movement through a torquing and twisting action at the waist. The term is coined after the method of extracting silk thread from a cocoon.</li>
<li>Directions:
<ul>
<li>Shifting: The primary exercise is the shifting back and forth from a right forward stance, through a horse stance, to a left forward stance. When you practice moving the hips and waist you should first use large movements.</li>
<li>Exaggerated movements stretch the muscles sending a clearer kinetic signal that provides biofeedback; making it is easier to feel which muscles are involved, and to learn how to control them.</li>
<li>Later the movement is refined and made more compact. The exaggerated movements of the `Long Arm' techniques where designed to teach silk reeling.</li>
<li>Twisting: Stand in a horse stance with the arms held in front, chest level with the elbows bent. Simply twist side to side using the arms as counter weights to help rotate the upper torso. As you twist back and forth, insure that the hips and knees are still, the action uses only the waist.</li>
<li>You should feel a tugging and pulling of the stomach muscles. If the knees or thighs move, than the exercise is being done incorrectly.</li>
<li>Level Movement: Most beginners when moving will raise and lower their center of gravity as they move from one movement to another.</li>
<li>Maintaining the same height throughout each movement requires superb muscle and balance control to effect correctly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tai_chi_walking">Tai Chi Walking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directions
<ol>
<li>Start with our right foot forward with your weight evenly distributed on both legs.</li>
<li>Shift your weight gradually onto your right foot and when all your body weight is transferred onto the right leg, then pull your left foot forwards until it is besides your right foot with the toes just barely touching the ground. Pause in this position for a moment.</li>
<li>Step forward with your left leg but do not put your weight on it right away. First touch your left heel to the ground while maintaining all your weight on your rear (right) leg. You’ll notice that you will have to bend your right knee a little so as not to immediately throw your weight onto the lead (left) stepping leg.</li>
<li>Slowly shift your weight onto your left foot and as you do so, roll the weight from your heel, along the edge of the foot and onto the ball of the foot until the weight is distributed equally along the heel, edge, and ball of the left foot.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>After a few minutes of practice you should feel a little fatigue in the leg muscles. This will continue until you’re leg muscles become stronger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hand movements
<ol>
<li>The hands move in coordination with the feet and resemble swimming. As the left foot steps forward, the right hand extends at shoulder level with the palm facing outwards as though pushing with that hand.</li>
<li>The left hand is pulled back to the shoulder with the wrist bent so that the fingers point forwards.</li>
<li>As you step forward with the right foot, pull the lead hand back to the shoulder, while the rear hand pushes forwards with the palm out.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="posture">Posture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apart from being more aesthetically pleasing to the eye why is there such an emphasis put on posture? Surprisingly there are several benefits to practicing correct posture.</li>
<li>This is what occurs with the vertebrae of the spine. Incorrect posture will force the vertebrae out of alignment. Instead of collapsing though, the spine compensates by absorbing the pressure into the muscles surrounding the spine and the disks between the vertebrae. Over time, this constant pressure from habitually bad posture will cause the deterioration of the disks and eventually the vertebrae itself. By this time, the person will usually have become debilitated by severe and chronic pain. Learning correct posture can prevent a lot of unnecessary pain and suffering due to chronic back problems.</li>
<li>Among Yogis and Taoists it was realized that posture and emotion are connected and that each can affect the other.</li>
<li>Recently modern medicine is discovering the same principles. Several therapies treat chronic conditions such as depression, pain, fatigue, and a host of other ailments by approaching the problem from a postural perspective first.</li>
<li>Posture can also be consciously manipulated to trigger a corresponding response in the nervous system. For example, when you are feeling tired and bored you will find your spine begin to sag forward and the head tilt downwards, while breathing becomes shallow and vision narrows.</li>
<li>Over years, the body memory of this posture becomes linked with the emotional state that elicits this posture. Anytime you start to feel tired, your body will assume more of this posture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.</p>
